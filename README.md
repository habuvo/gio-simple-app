# Trader AI

Trader AI is a fake trading app designed to be used as a testbed for the GioUI library. It's a simple app that allows you to trade stocks, monitor your assets and have an AI assistant help you with your trading decisions.

Everything is mocked for now because it is a showcase application for GolangConf 2024 [presentation](https://golangconf.ru/2024/abstracts/11883) about creating a real graphical interface with Go.

Here are the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQh-ommqKwjkbkrnMnQKcAhdC8_qYi6FbHZB6YfWM4N1G75W-be1X_-4pcRFTmS4Q/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) for that presentation.
